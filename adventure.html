		<h1>Nested if/else statements</h1>
		<p>It's entirely possible to nest if/else statements inside of each other.<p>
		<p>Look at the javascript on this page to figure out how</p>
		
		<script>
			var in_class = true;
			var bored = true;
					
			// our first conditional
			if(in_class) {
				console.log("You ARE in class!");
				
				// our second conditional, nested inside of the "true" code of the first conditional
				if(bored) {
					console.log("Brock is a bad teacher.");
				} else {
					console.log("Brock is a good teacher!");
				}
				
			} else {
				console.log("You're not in class.");
