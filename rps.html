		<h1>Rock/paper/scissors help</h1>
		<p>When playing this game, you'll be playing against the computer
		and you'll need to randomly generate a selection for them.<p>
		<p>Look at the javascript on this page to figure out how to randomly select
		an option from a list</p>
		
		<script>
			// create an array with the 3 options we can pick from
			var choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];
			
			// Few things going on here:
			// 1. Math.floor() is a function used to round a number DOWN (thus the use of the word "floor")
			// https://www.w3schools.com/Jsref/jsref_floor.asp
			
			// 2. Math.random() is a function that generates a random number between 0 and 1
			// https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp
			
			// 3. We multiply the VERY SMALL random number by the number of options we have to pick from
			// 4. Because the choices array is 0 indexed, we really only want 0, 1, or 2
			// Making sure we round DOWN will make sure we only ever get 0, 1, or 2
			
			var random_number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
			
			console.log("Should be rock, paper, or scissors: ", choices[random_number]);
